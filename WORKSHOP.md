# Workshop

### 01 Intro

>Openframeworks is an opensource C++ library (FRAMEWORK!!) primarily used for creative coding.
>It is a great tool for making computational sketches, interactive, and generatve art.
>Good online documentation via openframeworks.cc, forum.openframeworks.cc, and Lewis Lipton video tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Wzk_R1GoPkPqLo-obU_kQ

>It is also very easy to load shaders into your OF project via the ofShadere object:
>>shader.load()  loads a shader from files stored in your bin/data folder
>>shader.begin() - access your shader and use it for everything that comes after the function is called
>>shader.end() - stop using your shader.
